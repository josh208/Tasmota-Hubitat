# RELEASE NOTES

## Hubitat support

This fork adds Hubitat support to Tasmota. The original Hubitat fork of Tasmota was created by erocm123 (https://github.com/erocm123/Sonoff-Tasmota) and all credit for this fork is his. All I, markus-li (https://github.com/markus-li/Tasmota-Hubitat) have done is adapt it to a newer version of Tasmota and made minor changes.

## Fork maintenance

To keep this fork in-sync with the original Tasmota, firstly the Hubitat changes are kept in its own branch and then "git rebase master" is used against the original Tasmota.

## Changelog
